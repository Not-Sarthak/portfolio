# 0xSarthak

gm, I'm Sarthak

I'm a full-stack developer with an experience of working with multiple languages and blockchains.

Previously, I’ve interned at 2x early-stage startups and have won 7x hackathons🏆. I enjoy contributing to open source projects and currently am a contributor at [@0rbit💫](https://x.com/0rbitco).

Currently, I'm learning Rust 🦀.

Apart from code, I've always been passionate about cinematography. I'm trying to step out of my comfort zone to create both technical and non-technical content. I'm also a big sneakerhead and love traveling as a hobby.

And yes, A subtle nod to my admiration for Rossi: my dream bike is the Yamaha R1, specifically in black—there's just something about it.
