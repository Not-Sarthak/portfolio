  summary: `
I'm a full-stack developer with an experience of working with various languages and blockchains.

Previously, I've interned at 3x early-stage startups and have won 20x hackathonsüèÜ. I enjoy contributing to open source projects. I'm also a member at FBI (@callusfbi) and contributor at SuperteamIn (@superteamIn).

Beyond code, I'm passionate about cinematography and am stepping out of my comfort zone to create both technical and non-technical content. I'm a sneakerhead, love traveling, and enjoy endless talks on finance. Also, I play chess.
